# Arbitrary Precision Calculator Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

The Arbitrary Precision Calculator is a C-based application designed to perform arithmetic operations on extremely large numbers that exceed the capacity of standard data types. The calculator implements a system that can handle numbers of virtually unlimited size by storing them in a custom data structure based on doubly linked lists.

Each node in the linked list stores a portion of the number (up to 4 digits), allowing for representation of numbers with arbitrary precision. The calculator supports the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, handling both positive and negative numbers.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Data Structure

The core data structure is a doubly linked list defined in `header.h`:

```c
typedef struct cal
{
    int data;         // Data of the node (integer value)
    struct cal *prev; // Pointer to the previous node
    struct cal *next; // Pointer to the next node
} cal;
```

Each node stores a portion of the number (up to 4 digits in base 10,000), which allows for efficient arithmetic operations while keeping memory usage reasonable.

### 3.2 Algorithm Overview

#### Number Representation
- Numbers are stored in a doubly linked list
- Each node stores up to 4 digits (0-9999)
- For example, the number 12345678 would be stored as: [1234][5678]
- Signs are stored separately as boolean flags

#### Addition
1. Start from the rightmost digits (tail of both lists)
2. Add corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous step
3. Calculate new carry (if sum ≥ 10000)
4. Insert the result (sum % 10000) at the beginning of the result list
5. Move to the next digits and repeat
6. Handle sign logic based on whether inputs have the same or different signs

#### Subtraction
1. Compare the absolute values of numbers to determine the larger one
2. Start from the rightmost digits
3. Subtract the digits with borrow handling
4. Insert the result at the beginning of the result list
5. Determine the sign of the result based on input signs and relative magnitudes

#### Multiplication
1. Use the long multiplication algorithm
2. For each digit in the second number:
   - Multiply it with every digit of the first number
   - Handle carries
   - Shift the result based on position
   - Add to the accumulated result
3. Set the sign based on input signs

#### Division
1. Implement long division algorithm
2. Repeatedly subtract the divisor from the dividend
3. Count how many times subtraction is possible to get quotient digits
4. Set the sign based on input signs

   - Parse the input strings
   - Create linked lists for both operands
   - Split numbers into 4-digit chunks
   - Store sign information separately

3. **Operation Selection**:
   - Select the appropriate operation based on the operator
   - Handle sign logic for each operation
   - Call the corresponding function

4. **Perform Calculation**:

   - Store the result in a new linked list

5. **Result Output**:
   - Format the result with proper sign handling
   - Print the result to the console

6. **Memory Cleanup**:
   - Free all dynamically allocated memory for the linked lists

### 4.2 Sign Handling Logic

The calculator handles positive and negative numbers with special sign logic for each operation:

- **Addition**:
  - If both numbers have the same sign, perform addition and keep the sign
  - If numbers have different signs, perform subtraction of the smaller from the larger and use the sign of the larger number

- **Subtraction**:
  - If both numbers have the same sign, perform subtraction and determine the sign based on which number is larger
  - If numbers have different signs, perform addition and use the sign of the first number

- **Multiplication**:
  - Perform multiplication of absolute values
  - Result is negative if exactly one of the inputs is negative

- **Division**:
  - Perform division of absolute values
  - Result is negative if exactly one of the inputs is negative

## 6. Potential Interview Questions and Answers

### 6.1 Data Structure Questions

**Q: Why did you choose a doubly linked list for this project instead of other data structures?**

A: A doubly linked list was selected for several reasons:
1. It allows efficient insertion at both ends, which is crucial for our algorithms.
2. The bidirectional traversal capability is essential for arithmetic operations that require processing digits from right to left (as in addition and subtraction).
3. It offers dynamic sizing, allowing us to represent numbers of arbitrary length without pre-allocating excessive memory.
4. The structure naturally fits the way we process digits in arithmetic operations, particularly for carrying and borrowing operations.

**Q: Why store 4 digits per node instead of a single digit?**

A: Storing 4 digits per node (base 10,000) provides several advantages:
1. Memory efficiency: Storing multiple digits per node reduces the total number of nodes needed.
2. Performance: Fewer nodes means fewer pointer operations and memory allocations.
3. Processing efficiency: Working with larger chunks of the number at once reduces the total number of operations.
4. The choice of 4 digits is strategic because it fits well within the range of a 32-bit integer, avoiding overflow issues during arithmetic operations.

### 6.2 Algorithm Questions

**Q: How does your calculator handle the addition of two numbers with different signs?**

A: When adding numbers with different signs, the program actually performs a subtraction operation:
1. It first determines which number has the larger absolute value.
2. It then subtracts the smaller absolute value from the larger one.
3. The result takes the sign of the number with the larger absolute value.
For example, adding -100 and 75 is implemented as subtracting 75 from 100 and making the result negative.

**Q: Explain how your long division algorithm works.**

A: The division algorithm implements a process similar to long division:
1. It starts by comparing the divisor with the beginning portion of the dividend.
2. If the divisor is larger, it includes more digits from the dividend until it has a portion large enough to divide.
3. It then determines how many times the divisor can be subtracted from this portion (this becomes a digit in the quotient).
4. After subtraction, it brings down the next digit and repeats the process.
5. The algorithm terminates when all digits of the dividend have been processed.
This approach allows us to divide numbers of arbitrary size accurately.

### 6.3 Implementation Questions

**Q: How does your program handle memory management to prevent leaks?**

A: The program implements several strategies to prevent memory leaks:
1. Every dynamically allocated node is tracked through the linked list structure.
2. After each operation, the temporary result lists are properly freed.
3. At the end of program execution, all linked lists (operands and result) are explicitly freed.
4. The `free_linked_list` function systematically traverses the entire list, freeing each node.
5. When manipulating lists (removing leading zeros, etc.), temporary pointers are used to ensure nodes are properly freed.

**Q: How does your implementation handle edge cases like division by zero?**

A: For division by zero, the implementation:
1. Checks at the beginning of the division function if the divisor is zero.
2. If it is zero, prints an error message "Error: Division by zero."
3. Returns immediately without attempting the division operation.
4. In the main function, this is detected, and the program frees allocated memory before exiting.

### 6.4 Design Questions

**Q: What considerations influenced your modular design approach?**

A: The modular design with separate files for each operation was driven by:
1. **Separation of concerns**: Each arithmetic operation is logically distinct and warrants its own implementation file.
2. **Maintainability**: Isolating functionality makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
3. **Testability**: Individual operations can be tested independently.
4. **Code organization**: The structure provides clarity about where specific functionality is implemented.
5. **Collaboration potential**: Multiple developers could work on different operations simultaneously.

**Q: How would you modify your design to add support for floating-point numbers?**

A: To add floating-point support, I would:
1. Extend the node structure to include information about decimal position.
2. Add a field in the linked list structure to track the position of the decimal point.
3. Modify the string parsing functions to recognize and handle decimal points.
4. Adjust the arithmetic operations to account for decimal alignment during calculations.
5. Update the output functions to properly display decimal points in the result.
6. Add support for scientific notation for very large or small numbers.

### 6.5 Performance Questions

**Q: What is the time complexity of your multiplication algorithm?**

A: The multiplication algorithm has a time complexity of O(n×m) where:
- n is the number of nodes in the first number
- m is the number of nodes in the second number

This is because:
1. For each node in the second number (m iterations), we multiply it with every node in the first number (n iterations).
2. Each multiplication results in additions to the accumulating result.
3. The algorithm follows the standard long multiplication approach, which is inherently O(n×m).

**Q: How would you optimize the performance of your calculator for very large numbers?**

A: For optimizing performance with very large numbers, I would consider:
1. Implementing Karatsuba's algorithm for multiplication, which has a complexity of O(n^1.58) instead of O(n^2).
2. Using binary splitting techniques for division to improve its performance.
3. Increasing the base (digits per node) to reduce the number of nodes for very large numbers.
4. Implementing parallel processing for operations on extremely large numbers.
5. Adding memoization for repeated operations or sub-operations.
6. Optimizing memory usage patterns to improve cache efficiency.
