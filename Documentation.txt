Project Description:
This project implements basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
on arbitrarily large integers using a doubly linked list. Each node in the list represents a 4-digit chunk
of the integer, enabling operations on numbers larger than those that can typically be represented
by standard data types. The project supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these large integers.
