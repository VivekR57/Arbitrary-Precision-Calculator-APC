# ðŸ§® Arbitrary Precision Calculator

The **Arbitrary Precision Calculator** is a **C-based** application designed to perform arithmetic operations on extremely large numbers that exceed the capacity of standard data types. The calculator implements a custom **doubly linked list** data structure to handle numbers of virtually unlimited size, supporting **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** operations with full sign handling.

## ðŸ›  Project Features

- **Arbitrary Precision:** Supports numbers with virtually unlimited digits, constrained only by system memory.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Implements **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** for large numbers.
- **Custom Data Structure:** Uses a **doubly linked list**, with each node storing up to **4 digits** for efficiency.
- **Sign Handling:** Manages positive and negative numbers with appropriate arithmetic rules.
- **Error Handling:** Detects division by zero, input validation errors, and memory allocation failures.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Accepts input via **CLI** with validation and formatted output.

## ðŸ”„ Project Workflow

1. **Input Validation:**
   - Checks for correct argument count.
   - Validates the arithmetic operator and numerical inputs.

2. **Number Representation:**
   - Converts input strings into a **doubly linked list** representation.
   - Splits numbers into chunks of **4 digits** per node.

3. **Operation Execution:**
   - Selects the appropriate arithmetic function based on the operator.
   - Handles sign logic for operations with different sign inputs.

4. **Result Display:**
   - Formats the output with correct sign and digit placement.
   - Prints the result in a human-readable format.

5. **Memory Cleanup:**
   - Frees all dynamically allocated memory to prevent leaks.
